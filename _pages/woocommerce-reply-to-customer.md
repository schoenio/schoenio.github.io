  <p>This WooCommerce plugin makes the new order notification email that is sent to the store owner appear to have been sent from the customer's email address.</p>

  <p>This lets the store owner simply press "reply" within their email client to contact the customer about their new order.</p>

  <p>The plugin takes a minute to install, and will save a typical store owner hours of tedious work every year.</p>

  <p>Your purchase includes one year of support and updates, and the right to use the plugin on up to three domains.</p>

## Documentation

### How to install

1. Unzip the plugin files and place the plugin folder into your WordPress
plugins directory (usually /wp-content/plugins/).

2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress dashboard.

3. You're done!

### Troubleshooting

If you do not receive the new order notification emails after activating this
plugin, please try the following:

- Check that the plugin settings are correct.

- Check your spam folder.

- Check your mail server logs. Some mail servers (such as Gmail) refuse to send emails with a spoofed "From" header. If your hosting platform doesn't give you access to your mail server logs, use Mailgun instead (free, ten minute setup via https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailgun/) and inspect the logs via their web interface.

### Support

For support, write to [hi@schon.io](mailto:hi@schon.io). To help us assist you, please include the WooCommerce System Report in your email. To get this, login to WordPress WooCommerce System Status and then press the "Get System Report" button on that page.
